# Testing Application

I built this project to test my own database management skills. I really didn't plan this project at all. Most of this code was just randomly added, so please don't judge me based on the sloppy code.

## How it works.
I built this for the primary purpose of using for giving students tests in the real world. To get started, you have to create a student account (to create an account as a teacher, you have to do that manually with the code). After that you have to option to take tests that have been asigned to you.
